/*
Right now this tab remains empty. In future versions, the board should be connected to the PC by USB cable and the Gcode will be sent by pc and stored on the SD-card by this block,
eliminating the need to hastle with SD cards and having to change file names.

until then, this block will only be comment. I currently do not have everything together to send the Gcode by pc via serial. When I have, I will fill this block as soon as possible.
